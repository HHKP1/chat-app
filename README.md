# react-live-messenger
## Description
A real-time chat web app where users can log in, add friends and communicate with them in real time.

## Why?
This was a passion project. I built it for fun and to challenge myself.

## What I Learned
Through the creation of this project I gained a foundation in systems design and project management.

I learned how to use JWT for authentication and the basics of NGINX. 

Most of my growth came from the back-end implementations as I used front-end technology that was familiar to me. 

## Packages
- client - react.js frontend
- server - node.js backend
- common - code shared between client and server
